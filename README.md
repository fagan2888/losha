# Losha is a framework focusing on Distributed Similarity Search

## Apps
  - simhash
  - e2lsh
  - gqr + pca hashing

## Dependency
  - GQR (https://github.com/lijinf2/gqr)
  - Husky (https://github.com/husky-team/husky)

## Build

We assume you have set up a NFS director (denoeted as /data) that every machine can access it. 

    $ cd /data
    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/lijinf2/losha.git
    $ cd losha
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..  
    $ make help                     
    $ make -j4 Master
    $ make -j4 e2lsh 
## Configuration
Configuration files should be provided for different applications to fit the user's specific requirments and parameter for nearest neighbor search. An example file for configuration is provided as follows:

    # Required
    master_host=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
    master_port=yyyyy
    comm_port=yyyyy

    # Data management
    outputPath=zzzz
    itemPath=zzzz
    queryPath=zzzz

    # Optional Cluster Config
    hdfs_namenode=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
    hdfs_namenode_port=yyyyy

    # For Master
    serve=1
    hostname=localhost
    port=2016

    # Session for worker information
    [worker]
    info=master:3


For single-machine environment, use the hostname of the machine as both the master and the (only) worker.

For distributed environment, first copy and modify `$Losha_ROOT/scripts/exec.sh` according to actual configuration. `scripts/exec.sh` depends on `pssh`. An example of exec.sh is provided as follows:

    # Parameter
    BIN_DIR=zzzz
    CONF_DIR=zzzz
    MACHINE_CFG="$CONF_DIR/slaves"
    
    echo time pssh -t 0 -P -h ${MACHINE_CFG} -x "-t -t" "cd $CONF_DIR && ls -al > /dev/null && cd $BIN_DIR && ls -al > /dev/null && ./$@"
    time pssh -t 0 -P -h ${MACHINE_CFG} -x "-t -t" "cd $CONF_DIR && ls -al > /dev/null && cd $BIN_DIR && ls -al > /dev/null && ./$@"

where slaves is a file that provides the worker machine ID.


## Run a Losha Program

First make sure that the master is running. Use the following to start the master

    $ ./Master --conf /path/to/your/conf

In the single-machine environment, use the following,

    $ ./<executable> --conf /path/to/your/conf

In the distributed environment, use the following to execute workers on all machines,

    $ cp $losha/conf/exec.sh .
    $ ./exec.sh <executable> --conf /path/to/your/conf

## Dataset Preparation
LoSHa accepts FVECS as data formats. Please refer to https://github.com/lijinf2/gqr/tree/master/script for dataset transformations. Specifically, user may follow three steps:

- Transform dataset into FVECS format.
- Use sample_queries.sh to sample a certain amount of queries.
- Use cal_groundtruth.sh to obtain groundtruth.

Specific parameters should be provided to generate the correct datasets.
